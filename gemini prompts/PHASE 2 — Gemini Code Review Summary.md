PHASE 2 — Gemini Code Review Summary

✅ **Passed Checks:**

* **Database Schema:** The Dexie schema in /src/services/database.js is correctly updated to version(2) with the four required tables: photoSessions, deliveryJobs, customers, and settings. The primary keys and indexed fields align with the blueprint. The migration logic in .upgrade() is sound.  
* **Store APIs:** The public APIs for SessionStore, SettingsStore, CustomerStore, and DeliveryQueue are comprehensive and match the specified functionalities. CRUD operations, session linking, and job management are all correctly implemented.  
* **ImageService Logic:** ImageService.js is well-implemented. compressImage and makeThumbnail correctly use a canvas for processing, and burnTagsToImage provides a robust mechanism for rendering metadata onto a new Blob. The ensureBlob utility is a good defensive programming practice.  
* **EventBus:** The EventBus.js implementation is excellent. It correctly provides on/off/emit, returns an unsubscribe function, prevents duplicate listeners, and enriches payloads with a timestamp. Events emitted from the stores appropriately include sessionId.  
* **Debugger Enhancements:** DebugContext.jsx and the useDebug.js hook have been successfully upgraded. The new system correctly includes log levels, performance timing via debug.time/timeEnd, and functions for creating session-specific timelines and exporting logs.  
* **HostingService Mock:** The mock HostingService.js correctly returns the specified {url, filename, size} object and uses URL.createObjectURL to simulate hosting. The revocation logic in deleteUpload and clearAllUploads is present.

⚠️ **Warnings:**

* **Risk of Main Thread Blocking:** In ImageService.js, the functions compressImage, makeThumbnail, and burnTagsToImage all use FileReader and the main thread's canvas. For large images or multiple simultaneous operations, this could lead to UI stutter or unresponsiveness.  
  * **Suggestion:** For a future performance enhancement, consider moving these canvas operations to a Web Worker using OffscreenCanvas to free up the main thread.  
* **sessionStorage Limits in Mock Service:** The HostingService.js uses sessionStorage to store mock upload data. sessionStorage has a relatively small size limit (typically 5-10MB). Uploading a single large photo could exceed this limit and cause the mock service to fail. This is acceptable for a mock but makes it fragile for testing larger files.  
* **Potential Memory Leaks in Mock Service:** The HostingService.js creates object URLs via URL.createObjectURL(). While cleanup functions exist (deleteUpload, clearAllUploads), these URLs will persist for the lifetime of the browser tab if not explicitly revoked, consuming memory. This is a minor risk in a development context but a pattern to be cautious of.

❌ **Errors / Fix Recommendations:**

* **Incorrect Field in Schema Definition:** The schema definition for the photoSessions table is missing several key fields that are used in the application code but are not indexed. While Dexie allows this, explicitly defining all primary and secondary keys improves clarity and prevents future indexing errors. The tagsMeta field is used for searching in listSessions and should be indexed as a multi-entry index (\*tagsMeta.text).  
  * **File:** /src/services/database.js  
  * **Issue:** The photoSessions schema string is incomplete.  
  * **Fix:** Update the schema string to include all indexed fields and add a multi-entry index for tag searching.

* **Missing await in listSessions Filter:** In SessionStore.js, the listSessions function has a text search filter that is missing an await before the final .toArray() call, which will cause it to return a Dexie Collection object instead of the expected array of sessions.  
  * **File:** /src/services/SessionStore.js  
  * **Issue:** The text search branch of the listSessions function does not await the result.

### **Verdict**

**Pass with Fixes.**

The Phase 2 build is architecturally sound and very comprehensive. The core services are well-designed, and the enhanced debug system is a major asset. The identified issues are minor logical errors that are straightforward to correct. Once the recommended fixes are applied, the codebase will be in an excellent state to proceed with Phase 3\.
