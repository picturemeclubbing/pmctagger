## 🧠 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema (Dexie v8)
```javascript
// New tables added in Phase 8.0
customers: '++customerId, handle, name, email, phone, createdAt, lastDeliveryAt, tagCount'
customer_notes: '++id, customerId, createdAt, author, content'
customer_images: '++id, customerId, url, filename, thumbnailUrl, createdAt, updatedAt'
```

### Key Design Patterns

- **Concurrency Control**: Recursive setTimeout with ref-based polling flags
- **Parallel Operations**: Promise.all for customer, image, and note data loading
- **Efficient Search**: Map-based deduplication for search results
- **Blob Storage**: URL.createObjectURL for image handling
- **Responsive UI**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first design

### 🔗 Integration Points

#### **Phase 7.0 Integration**
- `attachDeliveryEvent()` automatically creates customers from deliveries
- Backfill operation migrates existing delivery logs to CRM
- Compatible with existing DeliveryAutomation.js and DeliverySimple.js

#### **Data Flow**
1. Deliveries trigger automatic customer creation/updates
2. CRM hook provides live data polling
3. UI components display filtered/sorted customer data
4. Profile operations manage notes and images

### 🧪 Key Validation Checks Passed

- ✅ Dexie v8 migration maintains Phase 7.0 compatibility
- ✅ Parallel data loading with Promise.all optimization
- ✅ Recursive setTimeout polling (not setInterval)
- ✅ Map-based search with deduplication
