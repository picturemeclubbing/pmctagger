# Phase 6.0a Customer Info Flow - Final Integration Patch

## Integration Completed: October 18, 2025

### Patch Summary
Successfully redirected the tagging workflow from Share page to Customer Info Form, completing the end-to-end delivery pipeline.

### Files Modified

#### SocialTagger.jsx
**Function**: `handleContinue()` (lines 271-278)
**Change**: Navigation redirect from `/share/${sessionId}` to `/collect/${sessionId}`

**Before**:
```javascript
navigate(`/share/${sessionId}`);
```

**After**:
```javascript
navigate(`/collect/${sessionId}`);
debug.log('navigate_to_customer_form', { sessionId });
```

### Integration Fix Details

#### Why This Fix Was Needed
- The Customer Info Form (`/collect/:sessionId`) is the new gateway for photo delivery
- Previous flow bypassed customer consent and delivery queue setup
- Share page was outdated and would not trigger proper delivery workflow

#### Debug Integration
- **Domain**: `[DELIVERY]` (as specified)
- **Event**: `navigate_to_customer_form`
- **Payload**: `{ sessionId }`
- Traces the transition from tagging phase to customer collection phase

### Updated User Workflow

#### Before Fix:
```
Upload → Tag → Share → [Direct Download - No CRM, No Queue]
```

#### After Fix:
```
Upload → Tag → Collect Customer Info → Gallery
                    ↓
            CRM Add/Update + Delivery Queue
                    ↓
            Professional Delivery Processing
```

### Technical Verification

- ✅ Route `/collect/:sessionId` exists and renders CustomerInfoPage
- ✅ CustomerInfoPage connected to CustomerStore and DeliveryQueue
- ✅ Form collects consent before adding to delivery queue
- ✅ Debug logging captures navigation event
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for direct navigation

### Impact Assessment

- **Positive**: Complete delivery workflow implementation
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Existing Share page remains accessible
- **Future-Ready**: Enables proper customer consent and queue management
- **Debug Traceability**: Navigation events logged for monitoring

### Deployment Notes

- This change completes the core tagging-to-delivery workflow
- Customer Info Form includes professional disclaimer and consent tracking
- Database schema v4 supports delivery queue operations
- All services fully integrated and tested

**Phase 6.0a Customer Info Flow Integration: ✅ COMPLETE**

*The tagging workflow now properly funnels users through customer consent and delivery setup, establishing the foundation for automated photo delivery.*
