PHASE 4 ‚Äî Gemini Code Review Summary‚úÖ Architecture IntegrityThe data flow and state management architecture for Phase 4 is sound. The introduction of customerId to the photoSessions table correctly establishes the necessary data relationship for CRM integration. The service layer is well-defined, with CRMService acting as a proper abstraction for high-level analytics, preventing bloat in the existing CustomerStore. The use of dynamic import() to manage circular dependencies between SessionStore and CustomerStore is a correct and effective pattern. The Dexie version(3) migration script is logically correct and safely preserves existing data.‚öôÔ∏è Implementation NotesSearch Strategy: The searchCustomers function in CustomerStore uses an indexed startsWith query on the tags array. This is highly efficient for prefix-based searches (e.g., "jo" matching "john"). The previous review noted a fallback manual filter, which has been removed in the final build file for simplicity; this is a reasonable simplification that prioritizes performance.Component State Management: The CRMPage correctly uses useSearchParams to manage the currently selected customer and view state (detail vs. edit). This makes the component's state bookmarkable and shareable via the URL, which is excellent practice.Hook Reusability: The useSearchFilter hook is well-implemented. It is generic, debounced, and correctly memoized with useMemo and useCallback, ensuring it will not cause unnecessary re-renders in the components that consume it.‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Fixes RequiredBlocking UI Call: The SessionCard.jsx component uses the native window.confirm() dialog for delete operations. This is a blocking call that freezes the UI and does not match the application's aesthetic.File: /src/components/gallery/SessionCard.jsxIssue: Usage of window.confirm() creates a poor user experience.Recommendation: This should be replaced with a non-blocking, custom-styled modal component to confirm deletion, providing a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application.üìã Files Verified/src/services/database.js/src/services/SessionStore.js/src/services/CustomerStore.js/src/services/CRMService.js/src/hooks/useSearchFilter.js/src/pages/GalleryPage.jsx/src/components/gallery/FilterBar.jsx/src/components/gallery/GridView.jsx/src/components/gallery/SessionCard.jsx/src/pages/CRMPage.jsx/src/components/crm/CustomerList.jsx/src/components/crm/CustomerDetail.jsx/src/components/crm/CustomerEditor.jsx‚úÖ Status: NEEDS REVISIONThe build is architecturally solid but requires the revision of the window.confirm() call before it can be fully approved for implementation.
